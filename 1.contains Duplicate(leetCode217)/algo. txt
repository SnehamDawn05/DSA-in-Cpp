Algorithm to check if an array contains duplicates

Initialize an empty set:

Create an empty unordered_set called set to store the unique elements we encounter.

Iterate through the array:

For each element nums[i] in the input array nums:

a. Check if the element is already in the set:

If nums[i] is found in set, it means we have encountered a duplicate.

Return true immediately because the array contains duplicates.

b. If the element is not in the set:

Insert nums[i] into set to mark it as seen.

If the loop completes without finding duplicates:

Return false because all elements are unique.
