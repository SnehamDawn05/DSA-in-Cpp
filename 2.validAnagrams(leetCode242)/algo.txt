Check lengths:

If s and t have different lengths, return false.

Count character frequencies:

Initialize an array arr[26] = {0}.

For each character s[i] and t[i]:

Increment arr[s[i]-'a']

Decrement arr[t[i]-'a']

Verify frequencies:

If any value in arr is not zero, return false.

Return true:

If all counts are zero, s and t are anagrams.

Time Complexity: O(K) where K = length of strings
Space Complexity: O(1) (fixed-size array of 26)
