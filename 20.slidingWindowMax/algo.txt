Use a deque dq to keep track of potential maximums in the current window.

Initialize the first window (first k elements):

For each element, remove elements from the back of dq smaller than the current element.

Push current element to the back.

Slide the window from index k to nums.size() - 1:

Remove the element going out of the window from the front if it equals dq.front().

Remove elements smaller than current element from the back.

Push current element to the back.

Record dq.front() as the maximum for the current window.

Return the collected maximums for all windows.
