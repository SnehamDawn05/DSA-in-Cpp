Initialize hashmap mp (key = character frequency signature, value = list of words).

For each string:

Build a frequency count of 26 letters.

Convert it into a key string (e.g., "1#0#0#...").

Insert the word into mp[key].

Collect all values from mp into result vector ans.

Return ans.
